        prevalent in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan">pakistan</a> with the highest prevalence in <a

    <h2>Child labour</h2>
    <center><img src="./images/4th.jpg" alt=""></center>
    <p class="fifth">Child labour in pakistan is the employment of children for work in pakistan, which causes them
        mental, physical, moral, and social harm. The <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Commission_of_Pakistan"> Human Right Commission of Pakistan
        </a>estimated that in the 1990s, 11 million children were working in the country, half of whom were under age
        ten. In 1996, the median age for a child entering the work force was seven, down from eight in 1994. It was
        estimated that one quarter of the country's work force was made up of children.</p>
    <h1><u>Health</u></h1>
    <h2>malnutrition</h2>
    <p class="sixth"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition">Malnutrition</a>is one of the most significant
        public health problems in Pakistan, and especially among children. According to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF">UNICEF,</a>about half of children are chronically
        malnourished.[31]</p>
    <h2>Polio</h2>
    <P class="seventh">Pakistan is one of the two remaining countries[37][38] in the world where <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio">poliomyelitis</a> (polio) is still categorized as an endemic
        viral infection,[39] the other one being <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan">Afghanistan.</a>[37] As of 20 July 2020, there have been 60
        documented cases in Pakistan in 2020, and 146 documented cases in Pakistan in 2019.[40][41] The total count of
        wild poliovirus cases in Pakistan in 2018 was 12.[42] By 1991, only 83 percent of Pakistani children had been
        vaccinated.[43] Research by the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention">Center for Disease Control
            (CDC)</a> in April 1998 cited a failure to vaccinate, vaccine failure, and inadequate immunization
        strategies as causes for the continued incidences[spelling?] of polio in this time.[44] Reasons for
        under-vaccination included the population being uninformed, considering vaccination unimportant, and having to
        travel long distances to vaccination sites.[44] <img src="./images/5th.jpg" alt=""></P>
